# ReDCO

ReDCO is a small research prototype for behavior-policy counterfactual branching
and dependency-sound replay in recursive dataflow agents. The active checkout is
intentionally optimized for human review, experimentation, and change—not for
preserving every historical campaign as executable production machinery.

## Active research surface

The maintained implementation contains:

- immutable event, seed, and branch contracts;
- content-addressed artifacts and exact policy-call caching;
- event-DAG tracing and dependency-sliced replay;
- deterministic and stochastic replay-equivalence checks;
- decision-normalized ReDCO credit assignment and loss evaluation;
- synthetic credit probes and estimator diagnostics;
- the CPU-only Gate GB research gate.

Start in these files:

- `src/redco/contracts.py` — shared research values and canonical JSON;
- `src/redco/algo/` — branching and training primitives;
- `src/redco/env/` — artifacts, tracing, policy caching, and replay;
- `src/redco/analysis/gate_gb.py` — the end-to-end CPU research gate;
- `tests/` — the focused executable specification.

## Run it

Redco uses `uv`, never `pip`.

```console
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen pytest
uv run --frozen ruff check src tests
uv run --frozen mypy
```

Run the cheap CPU gate with:

```console
uv run --offline --frozen python -m redco.analysis.gate_gb
```

It writes under the ignored `runs/` tree. Network, provider, model, GPU,
training, or scientific campaigns require separate explicit authorization.

## Algorithm in brief

ReDCO targets one policy decision before its action is observed, restores the
state immediately before that decision, and evaluates the original action
beside sampled alternatives. Rewards are converted into leave-one-out branch
advantages. The targeted action's ordinary trajectory credit is removed, then
replaced by the branch comparison; all other decisions keep their trajectory
credit. Each decision occupies one unit in the outer normalization regardless
of its token span, while its action log-probability remains the sum over its
selected tokens. The framework-neutral objective in `redco.algo.training` also
supports an optional squared log-probability drift penalty against the behavior
policy that produced the replay.

## Historical work

Old Stage C/D campaigns, launch protocols, provider integrations, reports,
configs, datasets, patches, and bespoke verification harnesses were retired from
the active checkout. They remain exactly recoverable from Git commit
`53a7c67c9cb6df39e44454f364aaf3c9ca352966`.

[`provenance/history-v1.jsonl`](provenance/history-v1.jsonl) is the normalized
recovery index: it records every pre-cleanup file's Git blob, raw SHA-256, byte
count, role, format, and safe schema metadata without rewriting the original
bytes. See [provenance](docs/provenance.md) for recovery instructions.

The concise guides are [architecture](docs/architecture.md),
[development](docs/development.md), and [provenance](docs/provenance.md).
